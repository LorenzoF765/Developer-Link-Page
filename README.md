# Introduction

This is a personal project of mine, just a simple website coded in HTML that displays both all of my social media (X, Instagram, TikTok) as well as professional links and documents (Resume, Github, LinkedIn) as well.
This was a very fun project, and it was just something that allowed me to work on my HTML and JS skill as well as allowed me to network easily and efficiently, something that is vital to a good end-of-college experience.


# Development

For The background, I used Vanta.js, specifically their dots variant.

Other than that, I used this video as a guide on proper installation for the background:

I also added a generic style.css for the buttons, as you can see. Typical HTML format.
All of the Icons used were found on Google, and the image of me was pulled from my facebook.


# Installation

As I mentioned above, to use an animated background like that, i'd look at Vanta.js, and see all of their options. The video also recommends using three.js, links below.

On top of those, you need a development environment capable of coding in
 - HTML
 - Javascript
 - CSS
